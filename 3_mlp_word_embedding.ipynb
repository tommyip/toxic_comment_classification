    "# MLP classifier with word embedding representation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous attempts, the comments text has been represented using a bag-of-words model. We were able to attain a respectable score, however, it is clear that it has trouble generalizing to new data. Words that brings toxicity are often times made up on the spot, so how ever big our token count dictionary is it can't cover the test set appropriately. Adding N-grams does not improve the model, which is disappointing. My theory is that toxic words are usually concatenated to a single token (eg _cock\\*\\*er_) so the captured n-grams (where n > 1) are just uninformative English phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we instead represent each comment as a dense word vector. We use a pre-trained model included with spaCy to vectorize each token, then we take the mean of the vectors as the document vector. Each document vector is fed into a multi-layered perceptron to predict the probabilites for each labels."

    "In our initial neural network with one hidden layer of size 100, the training score is reaching 1.0 while validation score is in the low 0.9s. This is a significant improvement over the previous Naive Bayes model, however, there also seems to be some overfitting. Deeper networks also overfitted wihout improving performance. We enabled the `early_stopping` option which stops training when validation scores stop improving to combat this problem. This also decrease training time which is a plus.\n",
